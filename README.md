it then calculates how 'good' the description is and ranks the pages in order of how good they are.
it can also output a summary of the descriptions.

the weights of each feature in the sentences ,e.g. adjectives is shown in this URL: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sbuzraqawh, there the order of the graphs
is the same as the order of the variables in the weighted function.
